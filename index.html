    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering, Visvesvaraya Technological University,
            Belagavi, GPA 8.34/10, August 2016 – August 2020</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Summary: The objective of this project was to create a mobile application to connect a person who needs help to
            someone who can assist in a situation like a pandemic or a natural disaster. We used Google's geolocation APIs
            and the GPS present in smartphones to track the live location of the victim and used firebase cloud messaging
            (FCM) to send distress signals to all emergency contacts and nearby help centers. This application would act as a
            powerful tool to decrease the response time to track and help a person in a situation of emergency.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Summary: The project aimed to create a tool to enhance India's healthcare management system. We built an
                android mobile application that collected the user's medical history and general information and stored it in the
                backend database. Whenever the user needed medical assistance, the application would track their current location
                using GPS technology and geolocation APIs and send them to the nearest ambulance. Until the ambulance
                reaches the user's location, the victim's medical history would be sent to the nearest clinic/hospital so that the
                doctor would complete the essential diagnosis based on the report and keep the operation theater ready, and this
                could save some precious time to help save the patient.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Summary: The project's objective was to create an autonomous robot to pick up things and put them in the
                designated location while following the shortest path and avoiding any obstacles. We developed a self-driving
                robotic vehicle that used a white line sensor for movement and infrared sensors to detect the barriers coming in
                front of it. The AVR ATmega 32 board was used as the microcontroller. The robot was installed with a 3-D
                printed arm mechanism to pick up objects. It was also installed with a color-detecting sensor to identify the
                object's color and place it based on the color</li>
